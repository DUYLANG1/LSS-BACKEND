# Refactoring Summary

This document outlines the changes made to refactor the NestJS backend project to follow best practices and clean architecture principles.

## Major Changes

1. **Project Structure Reorganization**
   - Moved from a layer-first to a domain-first (feature-first) architecture
   - Created dedicated domains for auth, users, skills, categories, and exchange-requests
   - Each domain contains its own controllers, services, DTOs, and entities

2. **Core Module**
   - Created a core module for shared functionality
   - Implemented centralized error handling with exception filters
   - Added logging interceptor for request/response logging
   - Added transform interceptor for consistent response formatting
   - Moved guards and decorators to the core module

3. **Configuration Management**
   - Created a dedicated config module
   - Implemented environment-based configuration
   - Added type-safe config service
   - Created separate config files for different concerns (app, database, auth)

4. **Health Checks**
   - Added health check endpoint for monitoring
   - Implemented database health check

5. **API Documentation**
   - Added support for Swagger documentation (commented out until dependencies are installed)
   - Documented all endpoints, DTOs, and entities with JSDoc comments
   - Prepared for API tags for better organization

6. **Validation**
   - Enhanced validation with class-validator
   - Added comprehensive validation for all DTOs
   - Implemented whitelist validation to prevent unwanted properties

7. **Error Handling**
   - Implemented centralized exception handling
   - Added custom exception filters
   - Improved error responses with more details

8. **Code Quality**
   - Applied SOLID principles throughout the codebase
   - Improved separation of concerns
   - Enhanced type safety
   - Added comprehensive documentation

## Required Dependencies

The following dependencies need to be installed:

```bash
npm install --save @nestjs/swagger swagger-ui-express
npm install --save @nestjs/terminus @nestjs/axios
```

## Swagger Documentation

To enable Swagger documentation, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install --save @nestjs/swagger swagger-ui-express
   ```

2. Uncomment the Swagger decorators in the controllers and DTOs:
   - Uncomment the import statements for Swagger decorators
   - Uncomment the `@ApiTags`, `@ApiOperation`, `@ApiResponse`, and `@ApiBearerAuth` decorators
   - Replace JSDoc comments with `@ApiProperty` decorators in DTOs and entities

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**
   - Add unit tests for services
   - Add integration tests for controllers
   - Add e2e tests for API endpoints

2. **CI/CD**
   - Set up continuous integration
   - Configure automated testing
   - Set up deployment pipelines

3. **Documentation**
   - Add more detailed API documentation
   - Create developer guides
   - Document database schema
